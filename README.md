# GoogleDriveCompanion

I was playing with the "google-drive-ruby" gem and thought it was awesome.  I don't like leaving the terminal, so I thought, meh, I am going to write a gem that allows me to push from the command line.
  Then, I figured: "Yo!"  The handshake takes to long, so why not set of a unix server socket to run as a daemon, listening for my google drive commands so that it will go faster.
  Sweetness!
